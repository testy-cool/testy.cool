# testy.cool SEO Optimization PRD

## Overview
Fix SEO issues identified in the site audit to improve Google indexing and search presence.

## Tasks

### 1. Compress Large Images
The following images are too large and hurting page load speed:
- apps/web/public/images/tools/chatgpt-conversation-exporter/export-chatgpt-conversation-markdown-html.png (4.0 MB) - compress to under 300KB
- apps/web/public/images/tools/hnes/hnes-screenshot.png (439 KB) - compress to under 150KB
- apps/web/public/images/avatar.png (691 KB) - compress to under 100KB

Use sharp or similar tool to convert to WebP format and resize appropriately.

### 2. Add Metadata to Tool Pages
The following pages are missing metadata exports:
- apps/web/app/(home)/tools/page.tsx - add metadata with title "Tools" and description
- apps/web/app/(home)/tools/hnes/page.tsx - add metadata with title and description
- apps/web/app/(home)/tools/chatgpt-conversation-exporter/page.tsx - add metadata with title and description

### 3. Fix Sitemap Configuration
The sitemap is missing several pages. Update next-sitemap.config.cjs to include:
- All standalone tool pages (/tools/hnes, /tools/chatgpt-conversation-exporter)
- All blog posts including /blog/tutorial/claude-code-ssh-setup
- Privacy page (/privacy)

May need to add additionalPaths function to manually include dynamic routes.

### 4. Fix Canonical URLs
In apps/web/lib/metadata.ts, the canonical URL is hardcoded to "/" for all pages.
Make canonical URLs dynamic so each page gets its own canonical URL.

### 5. Remove Unused Dependencies
Remove these unused packages from apps/web/package.json:
- katex
- rehype-katex
- mermaid (if not used)

Run pnpm install after removing.

### 6. Add JSON-LD Structured Data
Add structured data schemas:
- Organization schema on homepage
- BlogPosting schema on blog post pages
- BreadcrumbList schema for navigation

Create a component or utility to generate JSON-LD and add to relevant pages.

### 7. Fix Image Alt Text Issues
- In apps/web/components/og-image.tsx or similar, change "scrapedrive.com" to "testy.cool"
- In apps/web/content/blog/tutorial/setup-blog-with-testy-blog.mdx, improve image alt text from generic "Homepage" and "Post" to descriptive text

### 8. Expand Thin Content
These posts need more content:
- apps/web/content/blog/troubleshooting/windows-nul-file.mdx (~170 words) - expand to 400+ words
- apps/web/content/blog/tutorial/setup-blog-with-testy-blog.mdx (~350 words) - expand with more detail
