   - Implement breadcrumbs for better structure
   - Consider adding schema markup for better SERP features

## Root Cause Analysis

The data suggests multiple contributing factors:
1. **Content Discovery:** Google is not finding all your content
2. **Ranking Volatility:** Positions vary widely, indicating content relevance issues
3. **Click-Through Rate:** Even good positions aren't generating clicks
4. **Content Freshness:** Some previously indexed content may have lost relevance

## Next Steps

1. Would you like me to analyze your content structure against competing pages for your top queries?
2. Should we investigate your internal linking structure?
3. Would you like to check specific technical implementations (schema, meta tags, etc.)?

The extended analysis shows this isn't just a visibility issue - it's a combination of content discovery, relevance, and engagement challenges that need to be addressed systematically.
