<Callout title="TL;DR" type="info">
Google and Shopify co-created an open standard that lets AI agents buy things via API. Instead of redirecting to checkout pages, agents call endpoints. Your agent asks "does nike.com speak UCP?" If yes, it can complete a purchase without ever touching a browser.

## What this actually is

AI agents can't buy things right now. They can browse, they can recommend, but when it's time to pay? They hand you a link and say "go finish this yourself."

UCP fixes that. It's a spec - not a product, not a startup - that defines how agents talk to merchants.

```
// Today
User: "Buy me that hoodie"
Agent: "Here's the link! [redirects to nike.com]"
User: [fills out forms, enters card, confirms]

// With UCP
User: "Buy me that hoodie"
Agent: [calls API, uses your saved payment method]
Agent: "Done. Shipping Thursday."
```

## How it works

### Discovery

Agents check a well-known URL:

```bash
curl https://nike.com/.well-known/ucp
```

Returns JSON? They support UCP. 404? They don't.

### The flow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Discovery** - Agent finds merchant's UCP profile
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Negotiation** - Both sides figure out what they both support (checkout? discounts? fulfillment tracking?)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Checkout** - Agent creates session, adds items, sets shipping
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Payment** - User approves via Google Pay (or whatever). Token goes to merchant.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Done** - Order placed. Webhooks for shipping updates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Capability matching

Merchants publish what they support. Agents check what they can handle. They transact using the intersection.

```
Nike supports:     checkout + fulfillment + discounts
Your agent knows:  checkout + fulfillment
They use:          checkout + fulfillment ✓
```

The agent doesn't break if Nike adds discount support later - it just ignores what it doesn't understand.

    <CardDescription>
      You're building an agent that books flights or orders groceries. Right now you're either scraping (fragile), using proprietary APIs (one integration per merchant), or punting to the user (defeats the purpose). UCP means: implement once, buy from anyone who supports it.

      Instead of building integrations for every AI assistant (Alexa skills, ChatGPT plugins, Google Shopping actions), you expose one endpoint. As agents get better at shopping, stores without agent access lose that traffic.

## The technical bits that matter

### Your card number stays safe

The agent never sees your actual card. Here's the flow:

1. Agent tells merchant "user wants to pay with Google Pay"
2. Merchant says "cool, here's my payment handler config"
3. User approves in Google Pay UI
4. Google Pay gives agent an opaque token
5. Agent passes token to merchant
6. Merchant sends token to their PSP (Stripe, etc)
7. PSP charges the card

The agent only ever touches encrypted tokens. The merchant gets a token they can charge but can't decode. Only the PSP sees the real card number.

### Transport doesn't matter

The spec defines REST endpoints, but also works over MCP (Model Context Protocol), A2A (agent-to-agent), and embedded protocols. Same capability, different transport.

### Authorization proof for high-stakes purchases

For expensive stuff, UCP supports AP2 mandates - cryptographic proof that you actually authorized the purchase. Not just "the agent says you said yes" but "here's a signed assertion you can verify."

## Bottom line

Right now, asking an AI to buy something is like asking it to drive - technically possible in limited conditions, practically useless for most people.

UCP is infrastructure for a future where that changes. The bet is that agents will eventually handle routine purchases: reordering toilet paper, booking the same hotel you always get, buying concert tickets the moment they drop.

The security design (AP2 mandates, token isolation, handler-based routing) suggests Google and Shopify are thinking seriously about what "agent buys things for you" actually requires.

Shopify already implements this for their merchants. That's 4+ million stores with potential UCP support. Google Pay integration is baked in.

If you're building agents that need to transact, start here. If you're a merchant wondering how AI assistants will interact with your store, this is the standard that's emerging.
