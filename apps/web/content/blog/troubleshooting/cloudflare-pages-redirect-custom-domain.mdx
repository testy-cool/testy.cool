I have Cloudflare Pages deploying from GitHub with a custom domain. Both `testy-cool.pages.dev` and `testy.cool` work, but visiting the Pages URL shows Chrome's "looks fake" warning:

> The site you just tried to visit looks fake. Attackers sometimes mimic sites by making small, hard-to-see changes to the URL.

I'm not doing anything wrong. The issue? My Bulk Redirect wasn't matching the Pages hostname.

## Fix the Bulk Redirect Entry

Cloudflare's Pages docs expect the **exact** Pages hostname as the source (not `*.pages.dev/`) and specific parameters enabled.

In **Rules → Bulk Redirects → (your list) → Edit URLs**, set:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source URL** | `testy-cool.pages.dev` (no `*`, no trailing `/`) |
| **Target URL** | `https://testy.cool` |
| **Status** | `301` |

### Enable These Parameters

Click **Edit parameters** and enable all of these:

- Preserve query string
- Include subdomains
- Subpath matching
- Preserve path suffix

Save, and make sure the **Bulk Redirect Rule** that uses this list is **Enabled**.

### Test It

```bash
curl -I "https://testy-cool.pages.dev/some/path?x=1"
```

You should see `301` and a `Location: https://testy.cool/some/path?x=1`.

## About the "Looks Fake" Warning

That specific wording is Chrome's **lookalike-URL warning** mechanism. It's generated **in the browser** by comparing the URL to popular/previously-visited sites—it does **not** mean your site is hacked.

Once the redirect works and Google stops surfacing the `pages.dev` URL, users won't hit that warning anymore (because they won't navigate to the lookalike URL).

## Getting pages.dev Out of Google

After the 301 is working:

1. Make sure your site outputs canonical URLs pointing at `https://testy.cool` (and your sitemap uses `testy.cool`)
2. In Google Search Console, add a **URL-prefix property** for `https://testy-cool.pages.dev/` and use **Removals / URL inspection** to speed up cleanup
