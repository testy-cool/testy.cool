`NUL` is a reserved device name in Windows (like `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`). These files typically get created when:
- Cross-platform tools (Git, WSL, Linux apps) create files without Windows name validation
- File redirections or scripts accidentally use reserved names
- Extracting archives from Unix/Linux systems

## When NUL Occurs

- Working with Git repositories from Linux/Mac
- Running cross-platform build tools
- File operations that don't respect Windows reserved names

## How to Remove on Windows

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "\\?\F:\full\path\to\nul" -Force
```

**Command Prompt:**
```cmd
del "\\?\F:\full\path\to\nul"
```

The `\\?\` prefix bypasses Windows name parsing, allowing you to access files with reserved names. Always use the full absolute path.
