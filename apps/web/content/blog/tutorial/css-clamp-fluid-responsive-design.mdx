Ever notice how some websites feel janky when you resize the browser? Text snaps awkwardly between sizes at certain widths. Spacing suddenly doubles. It's because they're using **breakpoints** — fixed rules like "be this size on mobile, that size on desktop."

There's a better approach: **fluid scaling**. Instead of jumping between fixed values, your typography and spacing smoothly interpolates based on screen width. A heading that's 24px on a phone gradually becomes 48px on a desktop, hitting every size in between.

The CSS function that makes this possible is called `clamp()`. Here's how it works — and there's a [calculator tool](/tools/clamp-calculator) to generate these values automatically.

## The Problem with Breakpoints

Traditional responsive design uses media queries:

```css
.heading {
  font-size: 24px;
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .heading {
    font-size: 36px;
  }
}
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .heading {
    font-size: 48px;
  }
}
```

This creates **jarring jumps** at each breakpoint. Resize your browser slowly and watch the text snap between sizes. It's not elegant.

## Enter clamp()

The `clamp()` function takes three values:

```css
clamp(MIN, PREFERRED, MAX)
```

- **MIN** — The smallest the value can be (mobile floor)
- **PREFERRED** — A viewport-relative value that scales smoothly
- **MAX** — The largest the value can be (desktop ceiling)

For example:

```css
.heading {
  font-size: clamp(24px, 5vw, 48px);
}
```

Now the font size scales fluidly. At narrow viewports it's 24px, at wide viewports it's 48px, and everywhere in between it interpolates smoothly.

## The Math: One Design Value

If your designer gives you "48px at 1440px desktop", you can calculate the vw value:

```
vw = (target_px / reference_viewport) × 100
vw = (48 / 1440) × 100 = 3.33vw
```

So your clamp becomes:

```css
font-size: clamp(24px, 3.33vw, 48px);
```

**The problem:** At 430px mobile, 3.33vw = only 14px. That might be too small. You're guessing the MIN value.

## The Better Math: Two Design Values

If you have both mobile (430px) and desktop (1440px) designs, you can create a perfect line between them.

Given:
- Mobile: 24px at 430px viewport
- Desktop: 48px at 1440px viewport

The formula finds a linear equation `y = mx + b`:

```
slope = (desktop - mobile) / (1440 - 430)
      = (48 - 24) / 1010
      = 0.0238

intercept = mobile - (slope × 430)
          = 24 - (0.0238 × 430)
          = 13.77px

vw = slope × 100 = 2.38vw
```

Result:

```css
font-size: clamp(24px, 2.38vw + 13.77px, 48px);
```

This hits **exactly** 24px at 430px and **exactly** 48px at 1440px.

## When Linear Scaling Fails

Large values scale aggressively. A 60px heading at 1440px becomes 107px at 2560px if you let it scale freely. That's probably too big.

| Element | Desktop (1440px) | Linear at 2560px | Problem |
|---------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Body text | 16px | 28px | Maybe OK |
| Heading | 60px | 107px | Too big |
| Hero padding | 200px | 356px | Massive |

### Solutions

**1. Cap the MAX at desktop value**

```css
/* Don't let it grow past 60px */
font-size: clamp(24px, 4.17vw, 60px);
```

**2. Use a hybrid approach**

```css
/* Scale up to 1440px, then stay fixed */
.heading {
  font-size: clamp(24px, 4.17vw, 60px);
}
@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .heading {
    font-size: 60px;
  }
}
```

## Quick Decision Guide

**Do I have both mobile and desktop values?**
- YES → Use the two-point formula (pixel-perfect at both)
- NO → Use single-value formula, pick a sensible MIN

**Should this element keep growing on 4K screens?**
- TEXT → Usually cap at desktop size
- SPACING → Can grow larger (more breathing room is nice)

## In Tailwind

Use arbitrary values:

```html
<!-- Simple -->
<h1 class="text-[clamp(24px,3.33vw,48px)]">Heading</h1>

<!-- With base offset -->
<h1 class="text-[clamp(24px,2.38vw+13.77px,48px)]">Heading</h1>

<!-- Spacing -->
<section class="py-[clamp(40px,5.94vw+14.45px,100px)]">
```

## Common Patterns

Here are pre-calculated values for a 430px → 1440px design system:

| Element | Mobile | Desktop | Clamp |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| Hero Title | 36px | 130px | `clamp(36px,9.31vw+-4px,130px)` |
| Page Title | 28px | 85px | `clamp(28px,5.64vw+3.73px,85px)` |
| Section Title | 24px | 48px | `clamp(24px,2.38vw+13.77px,48px)` |
| Body Text | 16px | 18px | `clamp(16px,0.2vw+15.14px,18px)` |
| Section Padding | 40px | 100px | `clamp(40px,5.94vw+14.45px,100px)` |
| Card Gap | 16px | 32px | `clamp(16px,1.58vw+9.19px,32px)` |
