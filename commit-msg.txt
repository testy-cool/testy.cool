feat: Combine CSS clamp calculator with tutorial in blog post

- Move clamp calculator from standalone /tools/clamp-calculator to embedded in blog post
- Add interactive mini-tools: VwCalculator, ScalingPreview, BreakpointComparison, TwoPointCalculator
- Rewrite tutorial with progressive disclosure: builds from zero, explains WHY the math works
- Update /tools index to support blogPath for tutorial-embedded tools
- Update CLAUDE.md with tools page structure and tutorial writing guidelines

The tools index now links to /blog/tutorial/css-clamp-fluid-responsive-design
instead of a standalone tool page, following the pattern:
- Tool is the point -> /tools/[slug]
- Learning is the point, tool helps -> /blog/[slug]
