I'm just setting up my blog with Astro and I'm partly **vibe coding** it.

I'm editing the content for my Astro blog in Obsidian. By default, Obsidian has wiki-style links, like `[[link here|anchor text]]` and Astro works with markdown links `[such as this](suchasthis.com)`

So I swore up and down at [Claude, while using it in in Cursor](Cursor%20+%20Claude%203.7%20Is%20Too%20Eager.%20For%20Some%20Edits%20Use%20Claude%203.5.md), and it couldn't fix it.

I even added Playwright MCP, so it automatically can open a browser and check how it renders for itself.

Eventually I have up and I said fuck it, I'll just change the Obsidian wiki style links to pure markdown links (yes, I could've done that from the start but I just had to make it difficult).

BUT, before that, in a fit of rage, I undid all commits since I started this Wiki links endeavor, and mistakenly lost some articles I loved that I'll probably never get back.
